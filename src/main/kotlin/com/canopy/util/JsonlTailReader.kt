/**
 * Incremental line reader for Claude's append-only JSONL transcripts.
 *
 * Transcripts routinely reach tens of megabytes, and the plugin re-reads them on timers and
 * on every file-change event. Re-parsing the whole file each time costs time proportional to
 * the *history*, when the new information is proportional to the *append* — so a long-running
 * session gets progressively more expensive to watch. This reader keeps a byte offset and
 * hands back only the lines added since the last pass.
 *
 * Two details make that safe against a file being written concurrently:
 *
 *  - The offset only ever advances to the last newline seen, so a line the writer hasn't
 *    finished is left unconsumed and delivered whole on a later pass.
 *  - A file that shrank was rewritten rather than appended to (a transcript compaction, or a
 *    different session at the same path), so the offset resets and `onRestart` fires *before*
 *    any line is delivered, giving the caller a chance to discard accumulated state.
 *
 * Not thread-safe; callers hold their own lock.
