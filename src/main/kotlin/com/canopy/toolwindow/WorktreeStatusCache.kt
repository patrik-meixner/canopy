/**
 * Caches per-worktree git status for the Worktrees session list, so the table can show
 * uncommitted/unmerged state without every row shelling out to git on the EDT.
 *
 * Keyed by worktree *name*, not session id — several sessions can share one worktree, and
 * they'd otherwise each pay for the same sweep.
 *
 * ## Polling discipline
 *
 * A sweep costs ~2-4 short git invocations per worktree (~30-50 ms each), so the expensive
 * mistake is running it often, not running it at all. Every request passes four gates:
 *
 *  1. **Visibility** — nothing runs unless the panel is actually on screen. A hidden tool
 *     window or a non-selected tab means zero git processes.
 *  2. **Throttle** — event-driven requests coalesce to at most one sweep per
 *     [MIN_SWEEP_INTERVAL_MS]. This matters because the session list reloads on every
 *     transcript write, which is continuous while Claude is working.
 *  3. **Single-flight** — a request arriving mid-sweep is dropped, never queued.
 *  4. **Empty short-circuit** — no worktree rows means no git at all.
 *
 * The periodic tick is a backstop for changes we have no event for (the user committing in
 * a terminal), not the primary refresh path; becoming visible triggers an immediate sweep.
